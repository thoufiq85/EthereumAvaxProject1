# ErrorHandling Contract

This contract demonstrates error handling techniques using `require`, `revert`, and `assert` in Solidity.

## Contract Overview

The `ErrorHandling` contract allows you to perform various error handling operations:

- `checkRequire`: Checks a condition using `require` and increases the age by 5.
- `checkRevert`: Checks a condition using `revert` and increases the age by 5.
- `CheckOwnership`: Uses `assert` to verify the contract owner and increases the age by 5.

## Usage

1. Install Solidity compiler if not already installed.

2. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
